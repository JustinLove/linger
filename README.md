# Linger

## Defer the game over screen

The game over screen does not immediately appear. If you want to review the stats, a button is added to the lower right options bar which display the game over screen.

(Technically, it's been delayed for 24 hours.)

## Allow the chronocam to be hidden

Closing the chronocoam will not resume normal time.  It will also not trigger the game over screen.
